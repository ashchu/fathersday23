Don't have a photo, so improvised :D</p>

    <p>Hi Dad!</p>
    <p>This year, I decided to make a timeline of memories over the years. I know our family is one that often focuses on menories that aren't as happy or jubilant, so today, I wanted to focus on the moments that I often remember and make up the childhood that I grew up in. </p>
    <p>Every year, but especially this year, thank you for being a great dad. I think this year out of all years I've seen you grow a lot as a person and a dad. I think something engrained in many of us Chus is a form of stubbornness, so I personally think you're setting a huge precedent even if you don't know it.</p>
    <p>As a senior this year, I've been reflecting a lot. It's crazy... the final year before I'm supposed to officially fly off into the year. And with that, none of this, me, would've happened without you. I have a lot to be thankful for, especially thanks to you.</p>
    <p>During my time in college, I've been different yet still lucky from others. I don't have a family that came from other UCs or Ivy League universisties. I don't have parents who work in tech and can help me in problem sets. But I have everything else set up for in life. Parents who will go endless lengths for me. A dad who would help me package my entire apartment into boxes and drive back and forth for days and scrub the grounds of my apartment to make sure I'm set. A dad who would sit with me in a car for hours to make sure I make it to a destination safe. A dad who made sure I could pursue my dreams and more. </p>
    <p>I think it's hard. Because you weren't there consistently when we were all kids, but I think it goes to show that now you're always there. For the big and small wins and at least for me, that means the world and beyond.</p>
    <p>I recently had a nightmare I was driving in LA, and I was driving your car and I didn't put the car on parking mode after parallel parking and ended up hitting the others car parked. You were with me at the time, but you didn't yell or anything at me. You just made sure I was okay and I wasn't too shaken up and told me that the money would sort itself out later. I know that in past years, that's definitely not something I would immediately correlate with you... that constant security blanket feeling, but you've really been that for me in life and beyond.</p>
    <p>Looking back at these photos have been an equal treat for me. Because even though there are a lot of imperfections in who each of us are, there's so many positive moments I've had over the years with you that have made my life an incredible one.</p>
    <p>I feel like I can do anything thanks to you. So for that, happy father's day dad. Thank you for being you.</p>
    <p>I'm glad I can celebrate you and all that you do for us today.<3</p>
    <p>Love, Ashley</p>
